# Decrypting ciphertexts

### Let us see what goes wrong when a stream cipher key is used more than once. Below are eleven hex-encoded ciphertexts that are the result of encrypting eleven plaintexts with a stream cipher, all with the same stream cipher key. Your goal is to decrypt the last ciphertext, and submit the secret message within it as solution.

### Hint: XOR the ciphertexts together, and consider what happens when a space is XORed with a character in [a-zA-Z].


The whole idea of finding the decrypted text and secret message solely based on
analyzing and keep guessing until we get any part of the plaintext. Then further
using the key to decrypt it.

A crucial technique that helped to successfully decrypt is “Crib dragging”, which
is a known plaintext attack where if you can guess or know part of a plain text
message you can begin to decrypt other encrypted messages by dragging a
XOR of the known plain text over two or more messages
This is exactly what I did. Initially started my crib with “secret message”; this was
a smart guess, and luckily, it worked.
This was the first english statement i got → S class do not
And from here I kept on adding sensible words to the crib.

Another essential point was the relation between the ciphertexts. After taking xor
and converting it to ascii, there was somewhat of an obvious relation between the
ciphertexts. Ciphertext 1 and 11, 6 and 11, 1 and 2 are some of the ciphertexts
that I used concurrently. This means that the result of using crib on 1 and 11 is
also used on 6 and 11.

Moving on, all of this was a lot easier because the same key was used on all the
ciphertexts. Taking XOR of any two ciphertexts, cancels out the key leaving us
with the XOR of two plaintexts. Further, all the process of crib dragging was
applied.

As far as the hint goes, taking XOR of space (0x20) with any alphabet, changes
the case of the letter. For example if ‘a’ is XORed with space it will give ‘A’.
Similarly, if ‘A’ is XORed with space it will give ‘a’.
